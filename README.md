# Spotify_Clone
The project is a Spotify clone developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It offers users the ability to play a selected number of
songs from a predefined playlist. The application’s user interface closely resembles Spotify’s, allowing users to browse the playlist,
play, pause, skip tracks, and to keep track on the duration played. The project employs JavaScript to handle audio playback and
track selection, while HTML and CSS are used for structuring and styling the user interface
